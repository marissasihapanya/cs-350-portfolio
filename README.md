The aim of the project was to make a thermostat from the TI CC3220S XL Launchpad, using various interfaces we have built on throughout the course.
The thermostat needed to sense the temperature of the room then output the temperature to the console. Moreover, the thermostat needed to turn on a red LED to indicate that the heat was on. The heat mechanic was configured with setting a setpoint, which was changed by pressing the buttons on the side of the device. The project solved this thermostat problem by interweaving GPIO, I2C, UART, and timers, and interrupts.
For this project, I excelled in my persistence. The first day I sat down with the project and the starter code, it all ran with errors and did not output anything. However, I sat for hours at a time troubleshooting the reason why those errors persisted, and was determined to see what was wrong. I finally figured that the display macro and its succeeding calls were configured incorrectly, causing no .out file to generate when the code built. There were many times in this project where I felt stumped, but my determination kept me going and drove me to the end with a full implementation.
I could definitely improve with trusting myself more. Reading the code more and devising solutions on my own. I referenced documentation a lot and searched the web for answers, but I definitely want to sharpen my own mind and self reliance, so I can problem solve on my own. I see the value in referring to your resources, but I want to hold that type of independence.
The kind of tool/resource I'll add to my support network is technical documentation. There was a plethora of that for this device, so for both software and hardware development I do in the future, I will reference technical documentation thoroughly.
The skills that I can transfer to future projects are pieces I've mentioned previously here. Determination, self-trust, research, and curiosity are all skills I will continuously strengthen throughout my career; they will serve me well.
What allowed me to make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable: the development of my own functions to check the buttons and check the temperature. Then, using those functions in the main code to drive the functionality of the thermostat. Being able to produce your own reusable functions is a core piece of many applications.
This project allowed me to grow in many ways as a developer, and I am glad I stuck through to the end. I am extremely proud of the end result, and will keep it around as a reminder of what I can achieve.
